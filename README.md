I've created an unofficial telegram client based on plus-messanger. Telegram doesn't update its repository an doesn't published MTProto Proxy code. But I've added MTProto proxy to the plus-messanger source code. you can find the example APP in playstore:

If you need to integerate MTProto proxy to your Telegram client, contact me at robinhood.playstore@gmail.com .
